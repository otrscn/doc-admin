"At a meeting, a colleague tells Max about trouble ticket systems and how "

"system automatically generates an answer and sends it to the customer so "
"that the customer knows that his request has arrived and will be answered "
"soon. OTRS generates an explicit reference, the ticket number, for every "
"single request. Customers are now happy because their requests are "
"acknowledged and it is not necessary to send a second message with the same "

"A trouble ticket is similar to a medical report created for a hospital "
"patient. When a patient first visits the hospital, a medical report is "
"created to hold all necessary personal and medical information on him. Over "
"multiple visits, as he is attended to by the same or additional doctors, the "
"attending doctor updates the report by adding new information on the "
"patient's health and the ongoing treatment. This allows any other doctors or "
"the nursing staff to get a complete picture on the case at hand. When the "
"patient recovers and leaves the hospital, all information from the medical "
"report is archived and the report is closed."

"Trouble ticket systems such as OTRS handle trouble tickets like normal "

"request, a new ticket is generated by the system which is comparable to a "
"new medical report being created. The response to this new ticket is "
"comparable to a doctor's entry in the medical report. A ticket is closed if "
"an answer is sent back to the customer, or if the ticket is separately "
"closed by the system. If a customer responds again on an already closed "
"ticket, the ticket is reopened with the new information added. Every ticket "
"is stored and archived with complete information. Since tickets are handled "
"like normal emails, attachments and contextual annotations will also be "
"stored with each email. In addition, information on relevant dates, "
"employees involved, working time needed for ticket resolution, etc. are also "
