<title>Agents</title>

<para>
By clicking the link <emphasis>Agents</emphasis>, you get access to the agent management screen of OTRS (see figure below). Administrators can add, change or deactivate agent accounts. Furthermore they can also manage agent preferences, including the language and notification settings for the individual agent's interface.
</para>

<note>
<para>
An OTRS agent account may be deactivated but not deleted. Deactivation is done by setting the Valid flag to <emphasis>invalid</emphasis> or <emphasis>invalid-temporarily</emphasis>.

After the new agent account has been created, you should make the agent a member of one or more groups or roles. Information about groups and roles is available in the <link linkend="adminarea-groups">Groups</link> and <link linkend="adminarea-roles">Roles</link> sections of this chapter.
</para>

<title>Groups</title>

<para>
Every agent's account should belong to at least one group or role. In a brand new installation, there are three pre-defined groups available, as shown in Table 4-1.

<title>Roles</title>

<para>
Roles are a powerful feature to manage the access rights of many agents in a very simple and quick manner. They are particularly useful for large, complex support systems with a lot of agents, groups and queues. An example below explains when they should be used.
</para>

<para>
Suppose that you have a system with 100 agents, 90 of them with access to a single queue called "support" where all support requests are handled. The "support" queue contains multiple sub queues. The other 10 agents have permission to access all queues of the system. These 10 agents dispatch tickets, watch the raw queue and move spam messages into the "junk" queue.
</para>

<para>
The company now opens a new department that sells some products. Order request and acceptance, order confirmation, bills, etc. must be processed, and some of the company's agents are supposed to do this using OTRS. The different agents have to get access to the new queues that must be created.
</para>

<para>
Because it would take a long time to change the access rights for the individual agents manually, roles that define the different access levels can be created. The agents can then be added to one or more roles, with their access rights being modified automatically. If a new agent account is created, it is also possible to add this account to one or more roles.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Roles are really useful when dealing with complex organizations and when maintaining larger OTRS installations. Proper care is advised though. Mixing Agent to Group with Agent to Role mappings can make for a complex access control scheme, that is difficult to understand and maintain. If you wish to use only roles and disable the Agents &lt;-&gt; Groups option in the Admin area, you can do so by modifying the <link  linkend="ConfigReference_Framework:Frontend::Admin::ModuleRegistration:Frontend::Module_AdminUserGroup">Frontend::Module###AdminUserGroup</link> in the SysConfig. Be aware that this won't remove already existing Agents to Group assignments!
</para>
</note>

<para>
You can access the role management section (see figure below ) by clicking the <emphasis>Roles</emphasis> link on the Admin page.
